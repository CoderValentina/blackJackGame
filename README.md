# Blackjack Game
 blackJack is a Python card game where the goal is to get cards that add up to as close to 21 as possible without going over and competing with the computer.

## Features
The game deals cards and calculates the total value of the player's and computer's hands. It allows the player to choose whether to ask for another card (receive another card) or (keep the current card). It then automatically plays the computer's hand according to standard Blackjack rules.
